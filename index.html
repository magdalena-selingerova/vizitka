    <h1>Fantastic Mr. Fox</h1>

    <p>
      On a Hill, above the valley there was a wood. In the wood there was a huge
      tree. Under the tree there was a hole. In the hole lived Mr. Fox and Mrs.
      Fox and their four Small Foxes. Every evening as soon as it got dark, Mr.
      Fox would say to Mrs. Fox, "Well, my darling, what shall it be this time?
      A plump chicken from Boggis? A duck or a goose from Bunce? Or a nice
      turkey from Bean?" And when Mrs. Fox had told him what she wanted, Mr. Fox
      would creep down into the valley in the darkness of the night and help
      himself.
